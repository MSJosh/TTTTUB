//The AADSignInEventsBeta table is currently in beta and is being offered on a short-term basis to allow you to hunt through Microsoft Entra sign-in events. Customers need to have a Microsoft Entra ID P2 license to collect and view activities for this table. All sign-in schema information will eventually move to the IdentityLogonEvents table.
